Python Demos
============

A number of examples illustrating the use of the EveryBeam Python bindings can be found below.
:ref:`oskardemopointresponse` and :ref:`lofardemogriddedresponse` mainly illustrate basic functionality of the Python
bindings, whereas :ref:`lofardemolobes` demonstrates how the Python bindings can be used to generate an all-sky image for
the element and station response for a LOFAR observation.
